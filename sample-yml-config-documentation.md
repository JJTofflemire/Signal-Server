Sample.yml Config Documentation
=================

Dependancies
-----------------

- Required:

  - [AWS](#aws-iam-configuration)
  
  - [GCP](#gcp-configuration)

  - [Redis](#redis-notes)

- Optional, but won't function without configuration

  - Braintree

  - Datadog

  - Stripe

- [Here is an example of sample.yml with some shorthand comments](sample-with-added-comments.yml) (it probably won't be finisehd)

AWS IAM Configuration
-----------------

- Create an account with AWS

- Go to IAM and create a user with full access (this is definitely not entirely safe but hey, it gets the job done)
  
- Copy the access key and access secret, and paste them into `awsAttachments.accessKey` and `awsAttachments.accessSecret`, and `cdn.accessKey` and `cdn.accessSecret` in [sample-secrets-bundle](/service/config/sample-secrets-bundle.yml)
  
- If you give the IAM user full access, you can reuse the same access key and secret for both buckets

AWS Buckets Configuration
-----------------

- Go to S3 and create the two buckets below (I don't think you need to change any other settings)
  
  - aws-attachments
  
  - cdn
  
AWS DynamoDb Configuration
-----------------
  
- Sign into AWS, look up DynamoDb, and make tables of all of the following(not sure what to do about Partition Keys)

- If you change these names, also change them in [sample.yml](/service/config/sample.yml)
  
  - Accounts
  
  - Accounts_PhoneNumbers
  
  - Accounts_PhoneNumberIdentifiers
  
  - Accounts_Usernames
  
  - DeletedAccounts
  
  - DeletedAccountsLock
  
  - IssuedReceipts
  
    - expiration: P30D
  
    - generator: abcdefg12345678=
  
  - Keys
  
  - PQ_Keys
  
  - PQ_Last_Resort_Keys
  
  - Messages
  
    - expiration: P30D

  - PendingAccounts

  - PendingDevices

  - PhoneNumberIdentifiers
  
  - Profiles
  
  - PushChallenge
  
  - RedeemedReceipts
  
    - expiration: P30D
  
  - RegistrationRecovery
  
    - expiration: P30D
  
  - RemoteConfig
  
  - ReportMessage
  
  - Subscriptions
  
  - VerificationSessions

GCP Configuration
-----------------

1. Make a Google Cloud account and two projects

- Create an account with Google Cloud - you can you a pre-existing Google account, but you will have to add a payment method in order to use Google Cloud

- Make a new project for the bucket, and another for the encryption key

2. Create a service account to manage the encryption key

- Select the bucket project

- In the left navigation panel, select `Service Accounts` under `IAM & ADMIN`

- In the middle top, select `Create Service Account`

  - Under `Grant this service account access to project`, add the role `Owner` and the role `Cloud KMS CryptoKey Encrypter/Decrypter`

3. Create the bucket

- In the left navigation panel, select `Buckets` under `Cloud Storage`

  - Hit `CREATE` in the top middle of the screen
  
  - Configure it (I think the config doesn't super matter outside of how it handles keys), and select the region you want to use - I used `us (multiple regions in the United States)`

4. Create the encryption key

- Switch to the key project

- Select `Key Management` from the left sidebar nested inside `Security`

- A screen asking to enable `KMS` should appear - hit `ENABLE`, wait for it to load, then reload the browser

- Once here, there should be a button in the top middle of the sceen labelled `Create Key ring`

  - Create a key ring with a matching region to the bucket
  
  - The rest of the default configuration should be fine, so create the key

5. Linking the KMS created key to the bucket

- Switch back to the bucket project

- Click on the created bucket, and open the tab `CONFIGURATION`

- Near the bottom, there is a line: `Encryption Type`. Hit the edit button

  - Select the option for `Customer Managed Key (CMEK)`, and choose the key from the drop-down
  
  - The key probably won't show up by default, so hit `SWITCH PROJECT` and select the key project. The key should appear now
  
  - `SAVE`

6. Downloading the generated key

- I think you have to get 3rd party software to generate a key for you, then create a new key and import it (that way you can also generate a json on your own)

Redis Notes
-----------------

- Currently the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file has a redis-cluster generated by ChatGPT, using `Localhost` and ports 7000-7002

  - I am currently working both from my MacBook and an Ubuntu desktop, and the MacBook doesn't like this port selection. It could be a firewall or a vpn issue though.
